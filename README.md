# VacuumAgent
Simple Reflex Agent made to clean dirty surfaces

II. Reflex Agent Design
This reflex agent is made to clean dirty surfaces by the algorithm made in my program. The Ai Vacuum cleaner is made to locate which nodes in the grid are dirty and which ones are already clean. First the user inputs a x and y variable that is the height and width for the grid. Once that is input a random grid with clean nodes and dirty nodes is made. The Ai Vacuum is then placed at random on the grid and goes up one, left one, right one, or down one space until all the nodes in the grid are “clean”. Once the Ai Vacuum knows the grid is all clean it reports how many times it “cleaned the floor” and how many times it “change positions”. 


III. Task that your agent will solve
My agent is designed to dynamically look at a floor (grid), sized by user input, and decide whether its needs to “clean” a dirty node or go on, at random, to clean all the dirty nodes on the floor. When the program is done running it tells you how many “cleaned” the vacuum made to clean the floor and how many times it “moved” around the floor to clean it.
